Waterfall 
=========

Waterfall is a fork of the well-known [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) server teleportation suite.

Waterfall focuses on three main areas:

- **Stability**: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
- **Features**: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
- **Scalability**: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

## Why fork BungeeCord?

Think of Waterfall as a principles fork.

Waterfall was forked because of the fact that upstream does not accept many contributions that are intended to better the ecosystem. Simply put, Waterfall aims to better
the ecosystem by allowing changes to be exposed to a wider audience more quickly.

Waterfall will still track upstream BungeeCord and merge changes as needed.
